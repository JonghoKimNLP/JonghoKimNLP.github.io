  Hi, I'm a Ph.D. student at the Language and Data Intelligence Laboratory in SNU, under the supervision of Prof. Seung-won Hwang. 
  I'm interested in Strong AI: whether it is possible to create AI that is indistinguishable from the human mind. Currently, I'm interested in the ground of language models' **reasoning**, **uncertainty** issue in the real-world and real-human, and information retrieval.

          What is the proper reasoning behavior for the temporal reasoning? We mitigate spurious temporal reasoning of LMs by leveraging relative span-based timeline.
